 Two Desperados Game Jam; first level demo
 
 A cowboy started his transcedental journey to run from him self and dicover new levels of existance and worlds. But can he discover anything new if he hasn't discovered himself? 
 Facing onself as well as getting to know one self is the real transcedental journey to finding new horizons. In order to do that he will need to ''look himslef in the mirror and tell us what he sees''.
 
 First level is just a hint - mirrors are cassualy walking around, rarely reflecting the Cowboy. If he attacks them, they will chase after him. But in order to move to the next level he will need to face himself, even if the first step is to destroy the mirrors, and to go further to find the right one to discover the truth and himself alone.
 
 wasd and mouse movement, sprint, crouch, jump, shooting and coliding with objects and enemies, enemies walking around and chasing us when we attack them. Once killed, clone of the enemy disappears.
